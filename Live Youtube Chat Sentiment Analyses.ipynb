It’s a tragic situation.\\nREPLY\\nMichael Elijah\\n7 months ago\\nSomething I noticed is that the officers weapons search of Mr.Brooks only involved what seemed like a pat around the waste area and  then ended with the searching of what seems like Mr.Brooks  back pocket. The weapons search didn’t seem thorough enough to safely conclude that Mr.Brooks did not have any weapons.  A good weapons search would involve searching  from the waste down and or lifting up pant legs and searching the sides of the shoes.  And also searching from the waste up and or lifting up the persons shirt.  And searching all of the pockets as well.  Onto to the actual shooting of Mr.Brooks.  I’m not sure who’s taser was taken in the first scuffle. But assuming it wasn’t the taser of the officer which shot at Mr.Brooks ,that would mean he would still have the option to use his own taser. But something else to consider is how many shots was the taser capable of firing ? I’m talking about individual shots capable of being fired from the taser and not repetitive electric shocks sent from the taser to the already shot taser probes. So how many shots was the taser capable of firing,and was the officer aware of how many shots the taser was capable of firing ? If the taser was only capable of firing one shot,then the matter is a little different. Because if the taser was shot and missed the target ,and the officer still had his taser with him then he could have fired his own taser instead. Something else to consider is were the dangling taser probes still something to be deeply concerned about ? An other thing to consider is that given what seems like not a good enough weapons pat down,the officer could have still have had doubts with regards to whether or not Mr.Brooks had any weapons on him or not. Which would be a another reason for him to have to shoot Mr.Brooks. That little bit of doubt in the weapons search can make for lack of confidence/stability with regards to the officers handling of the whole matter.  A thorough weapons search helps rule out certain matters. It helps in moving forward with more confidence during the investigation. It can help in doing what’s best for the officer and the person being investigated. \\nRead more\\nREPLY\\nGladiator Spear\\n7 months ago (edited)\\nIam Latino and we know if you drink and drive and get busted. you have to do the time when you do the crime.

At first I was like he drew a weapon but then it was revealed it was a taser from the officer. So, they knew he did not have a weapon and had taken their taser. They have his car w/ the plates. It’s not like he was going to get away or was about to hurt someone. He was running away. Just like a home invasion, if you shoot at a robber, in the back, as they were running away, you’d be in trouble b/c you were not in imminent danger. Having an assailant’s back to you suggest they are trying to get away from you, not trying to harm you. A cop knows how far a taser can shoot, if he feared getting tased, he could have fallen back and it would not even reach. The guy fell a sleep at a drive thru, he will pass out again. There was no immediate danger to the police or the public. They could have canvased the area and prob found him passed out somewhere again or got his address from the plates and find him in his home passed out. They shot him bc they got emotional about getting punched in the face and having their weapon taken from them. Their egos got hurt and there’s nothing more dangerous than a cop with a bruised ego.\\nRead more\\nREPLY\\nDada Marc\\n7 months ago\\nResisting arrest and running and pointing taser gun at police not gonna end well.

You could always catch him another day and give him the additional charge of having resisted arrest. In the military I was taught that a firearm during peacetime is meant for protection, and only discharged when there is an imminent threat towards you or the people you are protecting. You are supposed to meet the escalation level, attempt to de-escalate, and never to escalate further. A taser may have been a threat (as seen in the extended version of this video), but not one that requires an immediate use of a firearm. Furthermore, shots should be made to disarm, and not to kill. Shooting and killing this fleeing criminal made the police the judge and the jury on that man’s life. If they had let him go then, the law would still have caught up with him eventually. Not all criminals deserve the death penalty.\\nRead more\\nREPLY\\nMzDaughtry 619\\n7 months ago\\nWhy does him being drunk and fleeing from the cops warrant his death?\\n35\\nREPLY\\nView 30 replies\\nLogan Lacher\\n7 months ago\\nThe guy overpowered two officers, took a taser, and fired it at an officer. Let\\'s say the police follow the CNN example, don\\'t use deadly force. Guy runs, deploys taser on cop #1. Cop#2 is now alone. Seeing as both cops couldn\\'t subdue him, what\\'s to say cop #2 is also subdued, a weapon acquired, and an officer killed? He already showed belligerence and intent to resist.

Some of yall think that if a person resist arrest than it\\'s an automatic death sentence because they must be a dangerous criminal. Think about it. We are not the smartest when we are drunk.

       " 'Something I noticed is that the officers weapons search of Mr.Brooks only involved what seemed like a pat around the waste area and  then ended with the searching of what seems like Mr.Brooks  back pocket. The weapons search didn’t seem thorough enough to safely conclude that Mr.Brooks did not have any weapons.  A good weapons search would involve searching  from the waste down and or lifting up pant legs and searching the sides of the shoes.  And also searching from the waste up and or lifting up the persons shirt.  And searching all of the pockets as well.  Onto to the actual shooting of Mr.Brooks.  I’m not sure who’s taser was taken in the first scuffle. But assuming it wasn’t the taser of the officer which shot at Mr.Brooks ,that would mean he would still have the option to use his own taser. But something else to consider is how many shots was the taser capable of firing ? I’m talking about individual shots capable of being fired from the taser and not repetitive electric shocks sent from the taser to the already shot taser probes. So how many shots was the taser capable of firing,and was the officer aware of how many shots the taser was capable of firing ? If the taser was only capable of firing one shot,then the matter is a little different. Because if the taser was shot and missed the target ,and the officer still had his taser with him then he could have fired his own taser instead. Something else to consider is were the dangling taser probes still something to be deeply concerned about ? An other thing to consider is that given what seems like not a good enough weapons pat down,the officer could have still have had doubts with regards to whether or not Mr.Brooks had any weapons on him or not. Which would be a another reason for him to have to shoot Mr.Brooks. That little bit of doubt in the weapons search can make for lack of confidence/stability with regards to the officers handling of the whole matter.  A thorough weapons search helps rule out certain matters. It helps in moving forward with more confidence during the investigation. It can help in doing what’s best for the officer and the person being investigated. ',\n",
